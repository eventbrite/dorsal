Dorsal
======

A JavaScript boilerplate automation system. Using bespoke plugins, Dorsal will
manage instantiating JS components and common design patterns. Developers need
only to mark up their HTML with specific classes, and data attributes where
necessary for configuration.


Examples
--------

* See examples/lorem.html for a use case that automatically inserts
  Lorem ipsum wherever a `.js-d-lorem` class is used.
